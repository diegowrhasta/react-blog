<h4 class="subtitle">Introduction</h4>
<p>
  This is my first blog entry ever, so it will probably be rough around the
  edges, but we all gotta start somewhere. Before going deep into different
  topics I guess I should just give a slight introduction into my way of
  thinking, the goals I have with this blog, and overall idea of how things will
  be formatted.
  <br /><br />
  So, who am I? I'm Diego, hi! I'm a (currently) 27 year old guy from Bolivia, a
  country in South America (Latin America). Currently at 5 years working as a
  software developer, been going at it endlessly and restlessly. I truly love my
  career, the things that I do and the people I get to work with. Blogging was
  something that I definitely have known about for a long time, however I never
  actually tried it, and after talking with others and learning more about the
  hobby, I found it amusing as a tool in order to let out both my own thoughts,
  but also emotions, process them, leave them there if someone can take
  something away from it, that sort of <i>stuff</i>.
  <br />
  This blog will definitely have a mixture of all sorts of topics, ranging from
  different interests and hobbies that I myself have and perhaps will develop in
  the future. One of the reasons there will be tags for entries is in order to
  easily display what topic will be tackled, I will definitely won't focus on a
  specific thing, there will be things about software development, there will be
  things about traveling, language learning, I <i>might</i> get into talking
  about personal stuff, but that's a big <i>might</i>, and other things that
  might pop-up out of the blue. <br /><br />
  But that's it, sounds about right for an introduction, I will now focus on
  three key words that I personally have found myself gravitating towards more
  and more as time passes.
</p>
<p class="definition">
  <b>
    Software: something used or associated with and usually contrasted with
    hardware: such as programs for a computer, the entire set of programs,
    procedures, and related documentation associated with a mechanical or
    electronic system and especially a computer system, materials for use with
    audiovisual equipment (Merriam-Webster, 2024)
  </b>
</p>
<h4 class="subtitle">Software</h4>
<p>
  A pretty <i>convoluted</i> definition, but a good one to start with in order
  to break down, paraphrase, etc. Software is basically the abstract concept of
  everything that in the modern day and age is associated with machines (that at
  their core) are computers. (Cellphones, Printers, Laptops, Game Consoles,
  ATMs, and many many others). Inside of all of these devices we have circuits,
  made out of different materials, ranging from copper all the way to gold and
  many other substances and materials in between. They all work in unison by
  redirecting electrical currents across the whole circuitry, but why? Because
  they are instrinsictely related to <i>Software</i>, by doing all of that and
  through peripherals such as screens, mice, keyboards, speakers, headphones, we
  as humans can interact with these machines, we press buttons, we give them
  signals, <i>impulses</i> in order for them to do extremely complex processes
  on the inside, just so a result is presented to us and useful to us in a way.
  At its core software is abstract, complicated and sometimes might feel as
  though it lacks purpose or sense in our day to day lives. But that is because
  we don't really think of it at its fundamental concept nor at the amount of
  work, artistry or even sheer brilliance that it came to bend nature, to work
  its materials and create this <i>black box</i>
  that came out of a fantasy novel that does so much and we don't event
  comprehend that volume of usefulness it has brought humanity.
  <br /><br />
  I'm fairly stupid, it takes me inconceivable amounts of time in order to get a
  concept, to really master some specific idea and then apply it. So Software in
  theory should be the worst kind of thing that I could focus on, but I got into
  it, and <i>might I say</i> I'm pretty good at it, because I came into it by
  accident, I simply looked at how things such as videogames that are a piece of
  software that bring people entertainment are made. I saw the amount of effort
  that goes into making them. I myself tried doing a bit of it with Warcraft's
  III editor, and learned core concepts about software and programming that I
  didn't even know where a thing until later when I went to Uni.
  <br />
  The more I learned about it, the more I liked it; at first I didn't know why,
  I just found it cool and interesting to have all these things you could tell a
  machine to do, I discovered web development, and then started my journey
  thanks to one specific professor that opened up my eyes to the sheer volume of
  opportunities and just cool people and things that can be achieved through
  software.
  <br />
  Fast forward some years and I've built things from the ground up, I've
  maintained already built systems, SaaS platforms for accounting, BPMs, Banking
  Portals, Online Coding Platforms, SaaS platforms for tow trucks. Seen teams
  ranging from 3 people all the way to the hundreds, and in my journey I've come
  across people from all walks of life, all ways of thinking, I definitely found
  ideas that I jelled with, ideas that I just couldn't be in agreement with,
  learned from brilliant minds, both on the technical but also on the spiritual.
  I was humbled, I got myself into trouble, I definitely earned enemies, but
  also great mentors and friends. Software develpoment is more of a people
  business than many give it credit for.

  <b>
    Pragmatism: a practical approach to problems and affairs, an American
    movement in philosophy founded by C. S. Peirce and William James and marked
    by the doctrines that the meaning of conceptions is to be sought in their
    practical bearings, that the function of thought is to guide action, and
    that truth is preeminently to be tested by the practical consequences of
    belief (Merriam-Webster, 2024)
  </b>
</p>
<h4 class="subtitle">Pragmatism</h4>
<p>
  Just as a preface I highly recommend
  <a href="https://shorturl.at/paBuh" target="_blank">
    The Pragmatic Programmer</a
  >
  as a guide into a different way of thinking (as a person and as a software
  engineer). As time passes more, the more I grow (old) and wiser, and even
  though I have years yet to come, I truly believe in something as sort of a
  <i>creed</i>. And it boils down to:
  <b><i>Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.</i></b> Now many could easily
  interpret this as a sort of libertarian invitation into chaos if one's not
  careful enough to try and take a more nuanced take on it. But (at least to
  me), it simply boils down to the idea of thinking for oneself. Of not simply
  applying dogma to both your professional and personal life. I definitely have
  some sense of kinship to books, movies, shows that peer into this way of
  thinking, not about hating society, not about being an outcast, but being an
  individual that thinks for himself, and that can choose for himself, for I was
  borned into this world, and I was (lucky) to be born as free as I could be.
  And for I also believe in <i>love</i>, and that it exists, even though it may
  not seem as so at times, but I've already taken a leap of faith and decided to
  <i>do a loving act.</i>

<p class="definition">For I was born not with hunger, but free</p>
<p>
  And so, this is what moves me, having seen so many realities, seen so many
  systems, work cultures, bosses, and colleagues, I can safely say that we
  sometimes think there's just <i>one</i> way of solving problems,
  <i>one</i> way of doing things, and always falling into the extremes is what
  actually leads into chaos, not wanting to accept one's own faults, not wanting
  to listen to others, by being laser-focused on one idea, and not looking at
  others, one can end up throwing a whole business into the ground. <br /><br />
  There will definitely be <i>better</i> ways of solving <i>some</i> specific
  problem, and depending on many factors your soulution or other's will proof
  itself, in practice, through data, through customers choosing your solution
  above others, if it was the <b><i>best</i></b
  >. But it takes a lot of personal growth, maturity, and experience to
  understand these things, to leave others do what they want within a reasonable
  margin of liberty. We are people building all these systems, we are people
  when making decisions as to how solve a problem for someone, there is room for
  objectivity but also subjectivity, and if your team is not on the same page,
  then the work will definitely be affected by this.

<p class="definition">
  <b>
    Epistemology: the study or a theory of the nature and grounds of knowledge
    especially with reference to its limits and validity (Merriam-Webster, 2024)
  </b>
</p>
<h4 class="subtitle">Epistemology</h4>
<p>
  I'm fairly certain if you've been working for more than three years, you might
  already know about this universal truth (I do have faith in that many do). And
  that is that one thing is the <i>theory</i> and another thing is what's put
  into <i>practice</i>. And it becomes ironic since sometimes you go back to
  books, blogs, things that you perhaps learned many years ago, and it now makes
  sense, you can now see what people meant when writing all of those concepts
  and ideas, and theories. But I truly believe that unless you go out there,
  unless you build things yourself, unless you see how your work directly can
  affect someone <b>for good.</b>
  You'll never truly experience what you are capable of and you'll never truly
  have this
  <i>eureka</i> moment. <br /><br />
  I'm not telling anyone how to live their life, if what they do is right by
  them, and if that thing does not hurt anyone. Then please keep doing it, be
  happy, enjoy your life however you wanna enjoy it. But when you get together
  in order to do something, and if not everyone has a good grasp as to what's
  expected of them, or if things should work a certain way, there's only so much
  you can do to make them understand. Surrounding yourself with good people and
  stuff aside, having hunger for knowledge, for learning more, for trying to get
  better each day is what gives meaning to my life and to the work I do. I love
  all about reading books, getting into tutorials, researching, building things
  on my own, but what ties it all together is that moment in which I realize how
  useful can this be for others. How this could help someone whenever they are
  having a problem, that's what drives me, I take as much as I can from what I
  see a direct use for, and things that I do not, I just let them be, if this
  <i>Agile Scrumban nonsense</i> is just making my team, the business,
  miserable, I'll drop it. I'll perhaps research other ways of doing it, or
  doing something else entirely. (Hey homebrewing it is always there if nothing
  seems to work). <br /><br />
  I once heard a great doctor said,
  <i>
    western medicine is so good, because they can accept a theory or treatment
    they deviced is bad and learn from that mistake.</i
  >
  and I think we in the software world can take from that way of thinking.
  Besides all the nerd stuff and nerd fights we get into, I do think that a
  clear vision and focus as to what is the most important thing should be a
  clear indicator as to when drop egos, when to open one's eyes up and getting
  back to work.
</p>
<h4 class="subtitle">What's all of this for?</h4>

<p>
  In the end, I'm just another person in the world, one out of more than 7
  billion out there. In the grander scheme of things I might be but a speck of
  dust. But for me, for the people I care about, the people around me, I could
  be a friend, a husband, a father, a mentor, a colleague, a Lead, a manager. I
  have the ability to impact others <i>(hopefully for good).</i> <br /><br />
  Not going to deep into the realms of <i>agnosticism, </i> the only thing I can
  say for certain is that I do not have all the answers, and I'm just trying to
  do what I feel is right, and that I truly want to help others and make the
  world just a tiny bit better. My answer to that is my whole career, software
  to me is something designed to help others in their own work, to solve
  problems and needs that people might have. I definitely started pretty
  confused and with really dogmatic, egotistical and overall limited views on
  programming, working and the meaning of everything I was doing. But with time
  I <i>learned</i>, I put my ego aside, focused on building communities,
  positive work cultures; fomenting reading, mentoring, becoming better. Work is
  not always perfect, and you have to come to terms with some things that you
  just don't agree with, but I truly think that if you love something so much
  you still want to do it outside of work hours. Then you have yourself
  something special right there. If you are happy doing something, then take
  your time and go at it, learn more, become extremely good at it, and
  opportunities, prosperity will come, even when it doesn't seem feasible,
  believe me, opportunities present themselves at the darkest of times, but it's
  up to us to take that leap of faith, sometimes sacrifice things,
  <i>if we really want that one thing.</i> <br /><br />
  I'll always be learning new things about software, probably get bored and jump
  into others, and then jump back. As I said at the beginning I will be writing
  about various topics, but I just want to leave this entry as this one thing:
  <b
    ><i
      >Do not give up, and live, experience, never fall into extremes, stay
      humble and love!
    </i></b
