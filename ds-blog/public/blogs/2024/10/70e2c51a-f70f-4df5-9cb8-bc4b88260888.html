<h4 class="subtitle">Introduction</h4>
<p>
  This is my first blog entry ever, so it will probably be rough around the
  edges, but we all gotta start somewhere. Before going deep into different
  topics I guess I should just give a slight introduction into my way of
  thinking, the goals I have with this blog, and overall idea of how things will
  be formatted.
  <br /><br />
  So, who am I? I'm Diego, hi! I'm a (currently) 27 year old guy from Bolivia, a
  country in South America (Latin America). Currently at 5 years working as a
  software developer, been going at it endlessly and restlessly. I truly love my
  career, the things that I do and the people I get to work with. Blogging was
  something that I definitely have known about for a long time, however I never
  actually tried it, and after talking with others and learning more about the
  hobby, I found it amusing as a tool in order to let out both my own thoughts,
  but also emotions, process them, leave them there if someone can take
  something away from it, that sort of <i>stuff</i>.
  <br />
  This blog will definitely have a mixture of all sorts of topics, ranging from
  different interests and hobbies that I myself have and perhaps will develop in
  the future. One of the reasons there will be tags for entries is in order to
  easily display what topic will be tackled, I will definitely won't focus on a
  specific thing, there will be things about software development, there will be
  things about traveling, language learning, I <i>might</i> get into talking
  about personal stuff, but that's a big <i>might</i>, and other things that
  might pop-up out of the blue. <br /><br />
  But that's it, sounds about right for an introduction, I will now focus on
  three key words that I personally have found myself gravitating towards more
  and more as time passes.

<p class="definition">
  <b>
    Software: something used or associated with and usually contrasted with
    hardware: such as programs for a computer, the entire set of programs,
    procedures, and related documentation associated with a mechanical or
    electronic system and especially a computer system, materials for use with
    audiovisual equipment (Merriam-Webster, 2024)
  </b>
</p>
<h4 class="subtitle">Software</h4>
<p>
  A pretty <i>convoluted</i> definition, but a good one to start with in order
  to break down, paraphrase, etc. Software is basically the abstract concept of
  everything that in the modern day and age is associated with machines (that at
  their core) are computers. (Cellphones, Printers, Laptops, Game Consoles,
  ATMs, and many many others). Inside of all of these devices we have circuits,
  made out of different materials, ranging from copper all the way to gold and
  many other substances and materials in between. They all work in unison by
  redirecting electrical currents across the whole circuitry, but why? Because
  they are instrinsictely related to <i>Software</i>, by doing all of that and
  through peripherals such as screens, mice, keyboards, speakers, headphones, we
  as humans can interact with these machines, we press buttons, we give them
  signals, <i>impulses</i> in order for them to do extremely complex processes
  on the inside, just so a result is presented to us and useful to us in a way.
  At its core software is abstract, complicated and sometimes might feel as
  though it lacks purpose or sense in our day to day lives. But that is because
  we don't really think of it at its fundamental concept nor at the amount of
  work, artistry or even sheer brilliance that it came to bend nature, to work
  its materials and create this <i>black box</i>
  that came out of a fantasy novel that does so much and we don't event
  comprehend that volume of usefulness it has brought humanity.
  <br /><br />
  I'm fairly stupid, it takes me inconceivable amounts of time in order to get a
  concept, to really master some specific idea and then apply it. So Software in
  theory should be the worst kind of thing that I could focus on, but I got into
  it, and <i>might I say</i> I'm pretty good at it, because I came into it by
  accident, I simply looked at how things such as videogames that are a piece of
  software that bring people entertainment. I saw the amount of effort that goes
  into making them. I myself tried doing a bit of it with Warcraft's III editor,
  and learned core concepts about software and programming that I didn't even
  know where a thing until later when I went to Uni.
  <br />
  The more I learned about it, the more I liked it, at first I didn't know why,
  I just found it cool and interesting to have all these things you could tell a
  machine to do, I discovered web development, and then started my journey
  thanks to one specific professor that opened up my eyes to the sheer volume of
  opportunities and just cool people and things that can be achieved through
  software.
