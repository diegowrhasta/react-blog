  A grid system is a design tool used to arrange content on a webpage. It is a
  series of vertical and horizontal lines that create a matrix of intersecting
  points, which can be used to align and organize page elements. Grid systems
  are used to create a consistent look and feel across a website, and can help
  to make the layout more visually appealing and easier to navigate.
